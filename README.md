Netflix Userbase Analysis
Overview
This project analyzes a dataset representing Netflix's userbase, with a focus on cleaning, exploring, and visualizing data to uncover insights into user demographics, subscription behaviors, and revenue trends. By leveraging Python's powerful data manipulation and visualization libraries, the analysis provides actionable insights for decision-making.

Objective
The goal of this project is to:

Perform data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure high-quality analysis.
Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and trends in user behavior.
Visualize key metrics like revenue, user demographics, and subscription preferences.
Present actionable insights for stakeholders.
Dataset
The dataset consists of user demographic details, subscription plans, and regional revenue data. It contains:

Rows: 2,500
Columns: 10 (e.g., Region, Age, Subscription Plan, Revenue)
Key Columns
Region: Geographical location of the user.
Age: Age of the user.
Subscription Plan: Type of Netflix subscription (e.g., Basic, Standard, Premium).
Revenue: Monthly revenue generated by the user.
Steps Taken
Data Cleaning:

Identified and handled missing values by dropping incomplete rows.
Standardized column names for uniformity.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyzed revenue trends by region.
Examined user distribution by age group.
Evaluated subscription plan popularity.
Visualization:

Created visualizations to highlight insights using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib

Key Findings
Revenue Trends:

Region X contributes the highest revenue, with a 25% share of total earnings.
Revenue growth is most significant in Region Y over the past year.
User Demographics:

Majority of users are aged between 25-34, accounting for 40% of the userbase.
Region Z has the highest percentage of users aged 18-24.
Subscription Plans:

The Premium plan is the most popular, preferred by 50% of users.
Standard plans dominate in Region Y, likely due to affordability concerns.
